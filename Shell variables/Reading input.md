# Reading input
***
Connected to host and read Pwn and then assigned PWN to COLLEGE as said.
***
Connected!
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read PWN
PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable, but it does not look like the value is correct.
Make sure that the value is COLLEGE!
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{sS8d56vDEQuElI6m-XjbR-BaAwF.dhzN1QDL4YzN1czW}
